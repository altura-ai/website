In 1990, a dynamic neural network architecture by Scott E. Fahlman and Christian Lebiere called “Cascade-Correlation” outperformed static neural networks in training speed, accuracy, and size. In a recent lecture, Fahlman actually called it the first approach to use something like ‘deep’ learning.
With this algorithm, they successfully competed on the ‘two spirals’ categorization task and artificial grammar learning problems.
